Routing (name of Feature 1)

(Technical description of the feature - 40ish words - 1 mark)

Express JS allows the user to use Routing to define the URLs to separate webpages by configuring the ending of a URL, which will allow the application to respond to a HTTP request method, with each route being able to have multiple request methods, which have seperae functionality, and executed when the URL is matched.

(A code block snippet example demonstrating the feature - 1 mark)

```js
    app.post('/add', (req, res) =>{
    STORAGE.push(req.body)
    res.status(201).json(req.body)
    console.log(STORAGE)
    })
```
